CPP Project: Speller
We've all played speller on board, where we get a certain number of letters and we have to form words and we get points for it. This project was a two player cpp implementation of the game. 
I made this in Turbo C++, so it may not compile with mingw or new gcc compilers as the implementation of graphics library **graphics.h** and other syntaxes are comparitively old.
### I agree to the fact that the colour theme could definitely be improved!
Below are some Screenshots of the game:
